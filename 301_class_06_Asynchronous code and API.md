In this class you will be building a React application that uses the Axios library to make user-initiated requests for data from a third-party API.

## Resources

[Axios on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios#features)

[Location IQ Geocoding API](https://locationiq.com/docs#search-forward-geocoding) - Specifically, the “Search / Forward GeoCoding” and “Static Maps” sections.

## Process

When available, your instructor will pair you with a partner for this lab. Spend the first 15 minutes planning out an approach to this lab’s work on a whiteboard.

Draw the web request-response cycle for the current lab tasks (about 15 minutes).
[Data flow](https://www.figma.com/file/c0RdZieKrKdUw3VRbLI1xq/Untitled?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=RKPpGrHgkqHHrPSQ-0)

Document the data flow: identify inputs and outputs for each part of the cycle.
_1. Client makes the request on the form - input_
_2. Submit it_
_3. Event triggered_
_4. Message sent to server via URL/API/Axios_
_5. Message come back from Server_
_6. Goes via API/Axios_
_7. Map to client server_

Outline the functions that support this data flow.
function App () all destructuring for objects
funciton handleSearch handle the form and searching
funciton getLocation handles get location
function getMap renders the map

Be sure to include these drawings in your README.md.

Implement your plan, coding in your own repository, submitting your own pull request.

Workflow
We will be using the Trello project management tool for the duration of this project.
To maximize your experience with Trello, you should create a free Trello account by clicking on the Sign Up button.

After creating an account, go to the City Explorer Trello Board, open the “… Show Menu” link, click the “… More” link, and then click “Copy Board”. Before you create it, be sure to “Change” from Private to “Public” (and click “Yes, Make Board Public”) so your instructional team can see your work. Now, click “Create” to add a copy to your personal account.
This Trello board contains all of the features required to complete this lab assignment.
Review the user stories and analyze the feature requests and requirements in the lab.
Within each story, note the acceptance criteria (“Given … When … Then…”) and the checklist of feature tasks. Be careful to execute tasks in order as they are often dependencies of one another.
Throughout the lab time, check off tasks as you complete them, and move the story cards through the workflow.
