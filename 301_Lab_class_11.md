# Process: Professional Pairing Practice

Much of the work you will be doing in the industry will be in pairs. When available, you will work with the same partner all module on this book app project.

When working with a partner, take at least 30 minutes to make a team agreement before starting on the assignment. This is an essential step to ensure a peaceful and productive module. You MUST answer the following questions in your agreement and include it in your README’s “Collaboration” section:

## Logistical

### What hours will you be available to communicate? 9am - 1800h

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind? _I would work extra hours to compelte the task at hand_

## Cooperative

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

## Conflict Resolution

### What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? _not healthy for the project_ \_discuss issues with the the other person, and if need be speak to TA and Teaching team.
