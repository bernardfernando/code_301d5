Retrospective

[This article ](https://www.benlinders.com/2013/which-questions-do-you-ask-in-retrospectives/) gives a nice overview to the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

## What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?

_React - very interesting, but still it has not sunk in. So many to learn. I had to note down:_

## npx create-react-app <name>

## npm start

## rfc (I had no extension for this)

## What did I learn today?

_React, map, spred, rest._

## What should I do differently next time?

_I have to be better prepared with pre-lesson stuff. Still I am behind._

## What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

_React, functions, destructuring objects._

Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

## Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

_I completed horned heasts, but it is really debugging and getting to know how react works. Still I have a long way to go to do it on my own. This is very interesting and I am determined to grab it._
_I intended to complete "about me" project, but I could not start_

Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity.
_I am trying to improve my weak areas, which I know of. i concentrated on them over the weekend. Still I have not satisfied with where I am_
