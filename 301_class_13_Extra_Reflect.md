Retrospective

What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down? _Project work. Syntax...(practice)_
What did I learn today? _I learnt a lot by Sam's CRUD presentation and followed by team members Frances and Chris's approach to work. There are so many I learned these two days by attending class in person._
What should I do differently next time? _Attend class as much as I can. Ask colleagues or Teaching staff without spending a lot of time trying to solve them by myself._
What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about? _Functions, arrow funcitons and syntax._
Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

Is the assignment complete? _Daily tasks completed by the team._ If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains? _Target met 90%_
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity.
