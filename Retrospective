Retrospective
Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

This article gives a nice overview to the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

### What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?

_Logic absorbed, but the way it was achived was complicated._

### What did I learn today?

Use of arrow functions, props and Stage in React, Use of Modals

What should I do differently next time?
_Prepare in advance....._
What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
_Logic for certain things understood, but the way they were implemented and why certain tools were used was not clear_

Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity.
_Assignment, completed with the code from Chris, but debugging had to be done and certain features that I could understand included in addition to basic assignment._
_Submitted late, debugging took a while, but good practice._
