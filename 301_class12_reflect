# Retrospective

## What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down? \_I should have done coding with Sam today. It was a nice one to code along and get the results.

_Today's lab was the first I completed before I came home. Thanks to Frances and Chris Palmer, my team mates today. They were super in their approach. I learned certain things that I did not know before. I wish I could attend classes everyday._ _Rich and Tim were of great help too_ - _they are at hand to help. Sam's Movie Demo went well._

## What did I learn today? CRUD - _Create, Read, Update and Delete._ _Movie demo by Sam L._ _and the lab was_ \_Can-Of_Books.\_\_

## What should I do differently next time? _Should be prepared and code along._

## What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about? _Loads to learn and practice, Functions is one of them (arrow functions, defrag)_

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

### Is the assignment complete? _Assignment completed - thanks to Frances and Chris._ _They were super and Time and Rich helped too_ If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

_Sams demo went well - excellent stuff._ _Thanks so much._
_Tim and Rich helped to sort out what we could not - thanks so much_
