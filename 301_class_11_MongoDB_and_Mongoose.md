Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL NoSQL

 <tr><th>SQL<td></td>NoSQL<td></td></th></tr>

    |  SQL                            |
    | ------------------------------- |  ------------------------------------------------------------|

| Relational | Non-relational, distributed |
| Table based - n columsn and rows| Document based: key value pairs, graph-db, wide-column stores|
| Predifinted schemas | Dynamic schemas for unstructured data
| Vertically scalable, | Horizontally scalable - increase the databases servers to reduce load|
| Structured query langues | unstructured query language
|

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? _Once that need complex intensive querying ( Accounting, math driven - shorter text; calculation intensive_)

## Give a real world example, _Accounting databases._

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? _Hierachical data storage._

## Give a real world example. big data, Hbase

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? _Non-SQL eg MongoDB,_

## Which type of database is best for scalability? _On a single server, SQL by increaseing CPU, RAM and SSD; NoSQL - by increasing the number of servers._

What does SQL stand for? _Structured Query Language_
What is a relational database? Tables have relationships: _One-To-One, One-To-Many, Many-To-Many_
What type of structure does a relational database work with? _Related Tables, with columns rows_
What is a ‘schema’? _Set of fixed columsn/fields_
What is a NoSQL database? _Non relational database - store data in a format other than relational tables_
How does it work?
What is inside of a MongoDB database?
Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. NoSQL, MongoDB
What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? _do not support ACID (Atomic, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)_
